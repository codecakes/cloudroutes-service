## What is Runbook?

[Runbook](https://runbook.io) is an open source monitoring service that allows you to perform automated "Reactions" when issues are detected. Runbook gives you the ability to automatically resolve DevOps alerts with zero human interaction.

Simply put, Runbook is what you would get if Nagios and IFTTT had a baby.

## Open source and contributing

Runbook is 100% open source and developed using the [Assembly](https://assembly.com/runbook) platform. Runbook runs as a SaaS application, with both free and paid plans.

With the Assembly platform, all revenue from the product is funneled into the project and its contributors. After subtracting business expenses, 10% goes to Assembly as a fee and the rest is given back to project contributors based on a percentage of their contributions.

Unlike other open source products, not only do you get the satisfaction of giving back to the community as a whole but you also get a cut of the profits. To get started, simply join us on our [Assembly Project Page](https://assembly.com/runbook).
