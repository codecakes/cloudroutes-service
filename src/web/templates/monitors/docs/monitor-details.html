            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This section of the documentation describes basic monitor configurations that apply to each monitor in general. The options in this section may not be applicable to all monitor types but most of the fields in this section are included in all monitors</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>General Monitor Options </h3>
            
            <p></p>
            <h4>Name</h4>
            <p>The name field is a required field that must be unique within your account. The name field should contain Alphanumeric input and does allow for special characters.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Reactions</h4>

            <p>This field is a multi-select field that allows you to add multiple or single reactions to a monitor. When a monitor returns a false status our system will execute the "False" tasks for each reaction, when the monitor returns to a true state our system will execute the "True" tasks for those same reactions. You can combine multiple reactions to perform a set of tasks. For example, on failure of a TCP port you may want to use the <a href="https://dash.cloudrout.es/dashboard/reactions/cloudflare-ip-remove">Remove IP from CloudFlare DNS</a> reaction to remove traffic from that server. After traffic is removed you may want to execute the <a href="https://dash.cloudrout.es/dashboard/reactions/saltstack-highstate">SaltStack Highstate via salt-api</a> reaction to ensure your servers are in a desired state.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Time Interval</h4>

            <p>The "Time Interval" field is used to select the queue to place this monitor in. If the queue is "Every 30 Minutes" the monitor will be called at least every 30 minutes, if the queue is "Every 30 Seconds" the monitor will be called at least every 30 seconds.</p>

            <p>This field is not applicable to all monitor types, for example the API monitors are not restricted to a specific queue and can be called numerous times in a row.</p>
            <p></p>


            <h4>Monitor Zone</h4>
            <p>The Monitor Zone field is used to select which Datacenter/Cloud environments a monitor should run from. This field allows you to select multiple Zones which will reduce the likelyhood of actioning false positives during outages or connectivity problems between our systems and yours.</p>
            <p>For Monitor Zones to work properly the Trigger setting for reactions must be greater than 1.</p>
