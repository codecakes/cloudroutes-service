            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The HTTP GET: Status Code monitor can be used to check the status of webservers and web based applications.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Monitor Details</h3>
            
            <p>This monitor will perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> on the specified url and page; the returned status code will then be checked against the selected status codes to validate success.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>URL</h4>
            <p>This field is used to target the HTTP <code>GET</code> request. This can be a domain or an IP address; however the entry must be in URL format such as <code>https://10.0.0.1/index.html</code>.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Domain to request</h4>

            <p>The domain field is used to specify the <code>Host</code> header of the request. This is useful for requests that address an IP address rather than the domain itself.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Using the URL and Domain to request</h4>

            <p>If you wanted to monitor the website at <code>http://example.com/status.html</code> and example.com resolved to <code>10.0.0.1</code> and <code>10.0.0.2</code> you could monitor each server by setting up two monitors. Each monitor would address the servers IP directly and use the Domain to request field to specify which domain to validate.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h5>Example Monitor #1:</h5>
            <pre>
URL: http://10.0.0.1/status.html
Domain to request: example.com
</pre>

            <p></p>
            <h5>Example Monitor #2:</h5>
            <pre>
URL: http://10.0.0.2/status.html
Domain to request: example.com
</pre>

            <p>This would allow you to monitor each server independently, and setup unique reactions based on each server.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Expected response codes</h4>

            <p>This field is a multi-select field that allows you to select the HTTP status codes that you expect your application or webserver to respond with. During the execution of this monitor we will check the HTTP status code we get in response to our GET request and if that code is not within the "Expected response codes" list, the monitor will be marked as false.</p>
