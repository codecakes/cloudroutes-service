            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The CloudFlare DNS: Replace an IP reaction is designed to provide Active-Passive DNS failover for domains that host their DNS with CloudFlare. This reaction can be used to provide DNS failover for systems that cannot run in an Active-Active state.</p>
            <p>An example of this could be databases; some databases support Master-Master replication however this replication strategy can cause conflicts when both systems are being written to at the same time. This reaction could be utilized to direct traffic to only one Master server and if any associated monitor fails this reaction can replace the first Master servers IP with the second Master servers IP.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction has two types of actions, one is executed when the attached monitors return "False" and another is executed when the attached monitors return "True".</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>False Monitors</h4>

            <p>When this reaction is executed with a "False Monitor" the reaction will use CloudFlare's API to query the supplied domains zone records. When the system finds an entry with the supplied IP or CNAME it will then use CloudFlare's API to replace that entry with an identical zone entry using the "Failover IP/CNAME". Effectively sending traffic that targets your DNS to your backup systems.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that if your current zone record is an A record we will replace it with another A record. We do not support failing over from an A record to a CNAME.<p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>True Monitors</h4>

            <p>Active-Passive failover is generally reserved for Disaster Recovery scenarios where one set of systems is completely down. Most Active-Passive failover architectures deploy Replication of some sort, however replication is rarely instant and after a long period of downtime the replication process may take quite a while. With this in mind, you can set the "Failback Method" to manual or automatic.</p> 
            <p>A failback setting of "None" will tell this reaction to perform no actions on "True Monitors", however "Automatic" failback will replace the removed IP's with the original settings. Effectively resetting your DNS to the position it was in before the failure occurred.</p>
            <p>The failback setting "None" is designed to prevent "flapping conditions" where the primary site goes offline sending traffic to the passive site, then primary site comes back quickly without data being replicated back from the passive site. In most cases with Active-Passive failover it is more desirable to manually migrate traffic back to the primary site.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Use Case:</h4>
            <p>This reaction could be useful for anyone wanting to utilize multiple cloud providers and cannot run their applications actively with both providers. As long as replication or periodic backups can be setup between the two providers a user could utilize one provider as its primary site and a second provider as its secondary site. This would prevent issues at a cloud provider level from taking down your application completely.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>TTL</h4>
            <p>It is recommended to keep the <code>TTL</code> of each record at <code>Automatic</code>, as this tells clients to look for DNS updates frequently which will reduce impact during issues.</p>

            <h3>Reaction Form Details</h3>
            
            <p></p>
            <h4>Email</h4>

            <p>The Email field should contain the email address associated with your CloudFlare account. This is a required field for CloudFlare's API and if it is not accurate we will not be able to perform API requests on your behalf.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Domain</h4>
            <p>The Domain field is the domain to manage, CloudFlare allows you to manage multiple domains under one account. This field is required for CloudFlare's API and allows us to perform changes only on the specified domain.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>CloudFlare API Key</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Where-do-I-find-my-CloudFlare-API-key-">CloudFlare API Key</a> is unique to your account, and is required to authorize requests for your account.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>IP/CNAME</h4>
            <p>The IP/CNAME field should contain the IP address or CNAME that you want us to remove. At this time we support IPV4 addresses and CNAME's; IPV6 IP's are supported in experimental status.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>Failover IP/CNAME</h4>
            <p>The IP/CNAME field should contain the IP address or CNAME that you want us to readd the entry with. At this time we support IPV4 addresses and CNAME's; IPV6 IP's are supported in experimental status.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>Failback Method</h4>
            <p>The Failback Method selection allows you to select either an automatic or none failback policy. It is important to choose the appropriate policy for your design, as automatic failback can cause issues if data has not been replicated fully.</p>
