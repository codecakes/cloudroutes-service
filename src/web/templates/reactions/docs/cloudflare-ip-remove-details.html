            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The CloudFlare DNS: Remove an IP reaction is designed to provide an Active-Active DNS Failover functionality for domains that host their DNS with CloudFlare. This reaction is mainly useful for sites utilizing round-robin DNS load balancing, at the moment CloudFlare does not perform health checks on IP's listed within DNS. However they do provide their users with an API that is capable of removing, adding and editing DNS records; CloudRoutes utilizes this API.</p> 
            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction has two types of actions, one is executed when the attached monitors return "False" and another is executed when the attached monitors return "True".</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>False Monitors</h4>

            <p>When this reaction is executing the "False Monitor" tasks it will first query CloudFlare to determine which entries should be removed. The DNS entry will be stored within our local cache in order to facilitate the "True Monitor" tasks. After the zone entries are stored locally our system will remove any entries that point to the specified IP or CNAME. The type of record is arbitrary to our system with the exception of <code>SRV</code> records, at this time we do not support removing and re-adding <code>SRV</code> records.</p>

            <p class="text-warning">Note: Our system will not remove any records that do not have a secondary entry. For example, if you had two <code>www</code> records; one that pointed to <code>10.0.0.1</code> and another that pointed to <code>10.0.0.2</code>. If the reaction was configured to remove <code>10.0.0.2</code> it would. If a second reaction was then told to remove <code>10.0.0.1</code> than our system would do nothing. This is designed to prevent a complete outage when issues may be occurring on both systems but are not impactful enough to completely take the system offline. It is generally better to route incoming traffic somewhere even if that system is not completely true.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>True Monitors</h4>

            <p>When this reaction is executing the "True Monitor" tasks it will first look through the systems local cache to identify any previously removed records. If the system finds removed records it will re-add to the DNS zone via CloudFlare's API. When the entry is re-added any optional configurations will be re-added as well; these options include but are not limited to <code>prio</code> for MX records, or <code>service_mode</code> which enables or disables the CloudFlare proxy (the orange cloud).</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>TTL</h4>
            <p>It is recommended to keep the <code>TTL</code> of each record at <code>Automatic</code>, as this tells clients to look for DNS updates frequently which will reduce impact during issues.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Reaction Form Details</h3>
            
            <p></p>
            <h4>Email</h4>

            <p>The Email field should contain the email address associated with your CloudFlare account. This is a required field for CloudFlare's API and if it is not accurate we will not be able to perform API requests on your behalf.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Domain</h4>
            <p>The Domain field is the domain to manage, CloudFlare allows you to manage multiple domains under one account. This field is required for CloudFlare's API and allows us to perform changes only on the specified domain.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>CloudFlare API Key</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Where-do-I-find-my-CloudFlare-API-key-">CloudFlare API Key</a> is unique to your account, and is required to authorize requests for your account.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>IP/CNAME</h4>
            <p>The IP/CNAME field should contain the IP address or CNAME that you want us to remove & readd. At this time we support IPV4 addresses and CNAME's; IPV6 IP's are supported in experimental status.</p>
            <p></p>
