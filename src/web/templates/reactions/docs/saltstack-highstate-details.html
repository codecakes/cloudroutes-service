            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The SaltStack - Initiate a Highstate reaction can be used to initiate a Highstate across your infrastructure. This reaction can be used to ensure that your environment is in it's desired state.</p>

            <p>For example, if we utilized a TCP Port monitor to check for port <code>25</code> you could attach this reaction to the TCP Port monitor. If your email service crashed the monitor would detect that port <code>25</code> is down. The monitor would then return "False", when the monitor returns "False" a SaltStack - Initiate a Highstate reaction will execute and send a POST request to salt-api. When SaltStack then runs the highstate across your infrastructure that will bring up the mailserver service, automatically resolving your email outage.</p>

            <p></p>
           <h3>Requires: salt-api</h3>
            <p>This reaction utilizes SaltStack's salt-api service; since salt-api requires some <a href="http://bencane.com/2014/07/17/integrating-saltstack-with-other-services-via-salt-api/" target="_blank">setup and configuration</a> we have provided some starter configurations to use in our <a href="https://github.com/CloudRoutes/integrations" target="_blank">integrations repository on GitHub</a>. You can utilize this reaction with very few changes to the configurations within our repository.</p>
 
            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction will only perform a single reaction, this reaction can be configured to occur on "False Monitors" or "True Monitors" but is not designed to be executed on both. In order to setup this reaction to have an action for "True Monitors" and a different action for "False Monitors" you can create two reactions and attach them to the same Monitor.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>False Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "False Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "False Monitor" the reaction will send a POST request to the URL specified, this post request will contain the following data fields.</p>
            <pre>
url: {{ postdata_url }}
secretkey: {{ postdata_secretkey }}
tgt: {{ postdata_tgt }}
matcher: {{ postdata_matcher }}
</pre>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "True Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "False Monitor"</p>


            <p></p>
            <h4>True Monitors</h4>

            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "True Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "True Monitor" the reaction will send a POST request to the URL specified, this post request will contain the following data fields.</p>
            <pre>
url: {{ postdata_url }}
secretkey: {{ postdata_secretkey }}
tgt: {{ postdata_tgt }}
matcher: {{ postdata_matcher }}
</pre>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "False Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "True Monitor"</p>

            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Form Details</h3>

            <h4>URL</h4>
            <p>The URL field should contain the URL of your salt-api instance. While technically our system will send the POST request to both HTTP and HTTPS URL's it is not recommended to use unencrypted HTTP for your salt-api instance.</p>
<p></p>

            <h4>Secret Key</h4>
            <p>The Secret Key field should contain the secret key for authenticating with your salt-api instance.</p>
<p></p>


            <h4>Target</h4>
            <p>The Target field allows you to specify a target for your service command, for example if you wanted to run this reaction on all webservers with a hostname of web-## you could specify <code>web-*</code>. The target can accept any format that is listed in the Matcher field.</p>
<p></p>

            <h4>Matcher</h4>
            <p>The Matcher selection field allows you to specify the format of the Target field, if you use a Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) for the hostname you should select <code>Hostname PCRE</code> if you use another format you should select the appropriate format.</p>
